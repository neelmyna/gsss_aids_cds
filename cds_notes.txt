SRP

float num = 4.75;


gcc steps:
1. pre processing (includes/opens/loads the mentioned files)
2. Compilation
	1. Syntax checking
	2. Translation (HR code to MR code)
	3. Interpretation (O/P is object code)
3. Linking (O/P: executable file)

gcc Options:
-E  To stop after pre-processing
O/P: User defined code + Library code
-c  To stop after compilation (object code is generated)
-o  To specify the target
gcc p1.c 
gcc p1.c -o p1 (This is to specify the target file)
gcc p1.c -S p1.s
gcc -lm p1.c (The math libraries are loaded and linked properly)

Cohesion
SRP (high cohesion)
Type casting (conversion of a value of a specific DT into another type)
Down cast
Up cast
Implicit up cast/down cast
Explicit cast

int main()
{
    float num = 17 / 3;
    printf("Num = %d \n", num); // 5
    printf("Num = %f \n", num); // 5.66666
}

-----------------------------
Unary & "Address of" Operator
It can be applied only to a variable (including a pointer, because a pointer is a variable).
When we apply & to a variable, we get its address.

Unary * "Dereferencing" or "Value at" operator
It can be applied only to an address (including a pointer, because a pointer holds an address).
When we apply * to a variable, we get the value present in its address.

*num
value at(5.5)

*(&num)
= value at [ address of (num)]
= v at[1351]
= 5.5
= num

Address of operator
Value at operator
Pointer variable
Data type of an address

Day2:
Number is not an address
Address is not a number
AAdress (pointer) arithmetic
Types of Pointers
Pointer to a pointer

What is a DS
Array as a DS
Implentation of Array
Function call stack (how functions work implecitly)
Recursion and REcursive functions, base condition and problems
String
String handling functions
Dymanic Array (maaloc and free functions)
Structures
	what is strcuture
	data encapsulation
	strcuture definition
	padding
	pointer to a strcuture
	strcuture within a strcuture
	self referential strcuture
